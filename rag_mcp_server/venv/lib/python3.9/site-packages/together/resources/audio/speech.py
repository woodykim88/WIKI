              return the encoded audio as octet stream

              for each model. For eg - for canopylabs/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft, one of the voices
              supported is tara, for hexgrad/Kokoro-82M, one of the voices supported is

              You can view the voices supported for each model using the /v1/voices endpoint
              sending the model name as the query parameter.

          bit_rate: Bitrate of the MP3 audio output in bits per second. Only applicable when
              response_format is mp3. Higher values produce better audio quality at larger
              file sizes. Default is 128000. Currently supported on Cartesia models.

          language: Language of input text.

          response_encoding: Audio encoding of response

          response_format: The format of audio output. Supported formats are mp3, wav, raw if streaming is
              false. If streaming is true, the only supported format is raw.

              canopylabs/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft and hexgrad/Kokoro-82M is 24000 and for
              cartesia/sonic is 44100.
