        Generate text completions for a given prompt using a language, code, or image
        model.

        Args:
          model: The name of the model to query.

              [See all of Together AI's chat models](https://docs.together.ai/docs/serverless-models#chat-models)

          prompt: A string providing context for the model to complete.

          echo: If true, the response will contain the prompt. Can be used with `logprobs` to
              return prompt logprobs.

          frequency_penalty: A number between -2.0 and 2.0 where a positive value decreases the likelihood of
              repeating tokens that have already been mentioned.

          logit_bias: Adjusts the likelihood of specific tokens appearing in the generated output.

          logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 of the top k tokens to return log probabilities for
              at each generation step, instead of just the sampled token. Log probabilities
              help assess model confidence in token predictions.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate.

          min_p: A number between 0 and 1 that can be used as an alternative to top-p and top-k.

          n: The number of completions to generate for each prompt.

          presence_penalty: A number between -2.0 and 2.0 where a positive value increases the likelihood of
              a model talking about new topics.

          repetition_penalty: A number that controls the diversity of generated text by reducing the
              likelihood of repeated sequences. Higher values decrease repetition.

          safety_model: The name of the moderation model used to validate tokens. Choose from the
              available moderation models found
              [here](https://docs.together.ai/docs/inference-models#moderation-models).

          seed: Seed value for reproducibility.

          stop: A list of string sequences that will truncate (stop) inference text output. For
              example, "</s>" will stop generation as soon as the model generates the given
              token.

          stream: If true, stream tokens as Server-Sent Events as the model generates them instead
              of waiting for the full model response. The stream terminates with
              `data: [DONE]`. If false, return a single JSON object containing the results.

          temperature: A decimal number from 0-1 that determines the degree of randomness in the
              response. A temperature less than 1 favors more correctness and is appropriate
              for question answering or summarization. A value closer to 1 introduces more
              randomness in the output.

          top_k: An integer that's used to limit the number of choices for the next predicted
              word or token. It specifies the maximum number of tokens to consider at each
              step, based on their probability of occurrence. This technique helps to speed up
              the generation process and can improve the quality of the generated text by
              focusing on the most likely options.

          top_p: A percentage (also called the nucleus parameter) that's used to dynamically
              adjust the number of choices for each predicted token based on the cumulative
              probabilities. It specifies a probability threshold below which all less likely
              tokens are filtered out. This technique helps maintain diversity and generate
              more fluent and natural-sounding text.

          prompt: A string providing context for the model to complete.

          echo: If true, the response will contain the prompt. Can be used with `logprobs` to
              return prompt logprobs.

          frequency_penalty: A number between -2.0 and 2.0 where a positive value decreases the likelihood of
              repeating tokens that have already been mentioned.

          logit_bias: Adjusts the likelihood of specific tokens appearing in the generated output.

          logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 of the top k tokens to return log probabilities for
              at each generation step, instead of just the sampled token. Log probabilities
              help assess model confidence in token predictions.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate.

          min_p: A number between 0 and 1 that can be used as an alternative to top-p and top-k.

          n: The number of completions to generate for each prompt.

          presence_penalty: A number between -2.0 and 2.0 where a positive value increases the likelihood of
              a model talking about new topics.

          repetition_penalty: A number that controls the diversity of generated text by reducing the
              likelihood of repeated sequences. Higher values decrease repetition.

          safety_model: The name of the moderation model used to validate tokens. Choose from the
              available moderation models found
              [here](https://docs.together.ai/docs/inference-models#moderation-models).

          seed: Seed value for reproducibility.

          stop: A list of string sequences that will truncate (stop) inference text output. For
              example, "</s>" will stop generation as soon as the model generates the given
              token.

          stream: If true, stream tokens as Server-Sent Events as the model generates them instead
              of waiting for the full model response. The stream terminates with
              `data: [DONE]`. If false, return a single JSON object containing the results.

          temperature: A decimal number from 0-1 that determines the degree of randomness in the
              response. A temperature less than 1 favors more correctness and is appropriate
              for question answering or summarization. A value closer to 1 introduces more
              randomness in the output.

          top_k: An integer that's used to limit the number of choices for the next predicted
              word or token. It specifies the maximum number of tokens to consider at each
              step, based on their probability of occurrence. This technique helps to speed up
              the generation process and can improve the quality of the generated text by
              focusing on the most likely options.

          top_p: A percentage (also called the nucleus parameter) that's used to dynamically
              adjust the number of choices for each predicted token based on the cumulative
              probabilities. It specifies a probability threshold below which all less likely
              tokens are filtered out. This technique helps maintain diversity and generate
              more fluent and natural-sounding text.
