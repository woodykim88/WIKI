        Supports single queries

        Args:
          messages: A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.

          model: The name of the model to query.

              [See all of Together AI's chat models](https://docs.together.ai/docs/serverless-models#chat-models)

          chat_template_kwargs: Additional configuration to pass to model engine.

          context_length_exceeded_behavior: Defined the behavior of the API when max_tokens exceed the maximum context
              length of the model. When set to 'error', API will return 400 with appropriate
              error message. When set to 'truncate', override the max_tokens with maximum
              context length of the model.

          echo: If true, the response will contain the prompt. Can be used with `logprobs` to
              return prompt logprobs.

          frequency_penalty: A number between -2.0 and 2.0 where a positive value decreases the likelihood of
              repeating tokens that have already been mentioned.

          logit_bias: Adjusts the likelihood of specific tokens appearing in the generated output.

          logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 of the top k tokens to return log probabilities for
              at each generation step, instead of just the sampled token. Log probabilities
              help assess model confidence in token predictions.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate.

          min_p: A number between 0 and 1 that can be used as an alternative to top_p and top-k.

          n: The number of completions to generate for each prompt.

          presence_penalty: A number between -2.0 and 2.0 where a positive value increases the likelihood of
              a model talking about new topics.

          reasoning: For models that support toggling reasoning functionality, this object can be
              used to control that functionality.

          reasoning_effort: Controls the level of reasoning effort the model should apply when generating
              responses. Higher values may result in more thoughtful and detailed responses
              but may take longer to generate.

          repetition_penalty: A number that controls the diversity of generated text by reducing the
              likelihood of repeated sequences. Higher values decrease repetition.

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured
              Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more
              in the [Structured Outputs guide](https://docs.together.ai/docs/json-mode).

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which
              ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is
              preferred for models that support it.

          safety_model: The name of the moderation model used to validate tokens. Choose from the
              available moderation models found
              [here](https://docs.together.ai/docs/inference-models#moderation-models).

          seed: Seed value for reproducibility.

          stop: A list of string sequences that will truncate (stop) inference text output. For
              example, "</s>" will stop generation as soon as the model generates the given
              token.

          stream: If true, stream tokens as Server-Sent Events as the model generates them instead
              of waiting for the full model response. The stream terminates with
              `data: [DONE]`. If false, return a single JSON object containing the results.

          temperature: A decimal number from 0-1 that determines the degree of randomness in the
              response. A temperature less than 1 favors more correctness and is appropriate
              for question answering or summarization. A value closer to 1 introduces more
              randomness in the output.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. By default uses `auto`,
              which lets the model pick between generating a message or calling a function.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for.

          top_k: An integer that's used to limit the number of choices for the next predicted
              word or token. It specifies the maximum number of tokens to consider at each
              step, based on their probability of occurrence. This technique helps to speed up
              the generation process and can improve the quality of the generated text by
              focusing on the most likely options.

          top_p: A percentage (also called the nucleus parameter) that's used to dynamically
              adjust the number of choices for each predicted token based on the cumulative
              probabilities. It specifies a probability threshold below which all less likely
              tokens are filtered out. This technique helps maintain diversity and generate
              more fluent and natural-sounding text.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

          temperature: A decimal number from 0-1 that determines the degree of randomness in the
              response. A temperature less than 1 favors more correctness and is appropriate
              for question answering or summarization. A value closer to 1 introduces more
              randomness in the output.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. By default uses `auto`,
              which lets the model pick between generating a message or calling a function.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for.

          top_k: An integer that's used to limit the number of choices for the next predicted
              word or token. It specifies the maximum number of tokens to consider at each
              step, based on their probability of occurrence. This technique helps to speed up
              the generation process and can improve the quality of the generated text by
              focusing on the most likely options.

          top_p: A percentage (also called the nucleus parameter) that's used to dynamically
              adjust the number of choices for each predicted token based on the cumulative
              probabilities. It specifies a probability threshold below which all less likely
              tokens are filtered out. This technique helps maintain diversity and generate
              more fluent and natural-sounding text.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

          chat_template_kwargs: Additional configuration to pass to model engine.

          context_length_exceeded_behavior: Defined the behavior of the API when max_tokens exceed the maximum context
              length of the model. When set to 'error', API will return 400 with appropriate
              error message. When set to 'truncate', override the max_tokens with maximum
              context length of the model.

          echo: If true, the response will contain the prompt. Can be used with `logprobs` to
              return prompt logprobs.

          frequency_penalty: A number between -2.0 and 2.0 where a positive value decreases the likelihood of
              repeating tokens that have already been mentioned.

          logit_bias: Adjusts the likelihood of specific tokens appearing in the generated output.

          logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 of the top k tokens to return log probabilities for
              at each generation step, instead of just the sampled token. Log probabilities
              help assess model confidence in token predictions.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate.

          min_p: A number between 0 and 1 that can be used as an alternative to top_p and top-k.

          n: The number of completions to generate for each prompt.

          presence_penalty: A number between -2.0 and 2.0 where a positive value increases the likelihood of
              a model talking about new topics.

          reasoning: For models that support toggling reasoning functionality, this object can be
              used to control that functionality.

          reasoning_effort: Controls the level of reasoning effort the model should apply when generating
              responses. Higher values may result in more thoughtful and detailed responses
              but may take longer to generate.

          repetition_penalty: A number that controls the diversity of generated text by reducing the
              likelihood of repeated sequences. Higher values decrease repetition.

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured
              Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more
              in the [Structured Outputs guide](https://docs.together.ai/docs/json-mode).

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which
              ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is
              preferred for models that support it.

          safety_model: The name of the moderation model used to validate tokens. Choose from the
              available moderation models found
              [here](https://docs.together.ai/docs/inference-models#moderation-models).

          seed: Seed value for reproducibility.

          stop: A list of string sequences that will truncate (stop) inference text output. For
              example, "</s>" will stop generation as soon as the model generates the given
              token.

          stream: If true, stream tokens as Server-Sent Events as the model generates them instead
              of waiting for the full model response. The stream terminates with
              `data: [DONE]`. If false, return a single JSON object containing the results.

          temperature: A decimal number from 0-1 that determines the degree of randomness in the
              response. A temperature less than 1 favors more correctness and is appropriate

        """Generate a model response for a given chat conversation.

        Supports single queries
        and multi-turn conversations with system, user, and assistant messages.

        Args:
          messages: A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.

          model: The name of the model to query.

              [See all of Together AI's chat models](https://docs.together.ai/docs/serverless-models#chat-models)

          stream: If true, stream tokens as Server-Sent Events as the model generates them instead
              of waiting for the full model response. The stream terminates with
              `data: [DONE]`. If false, return a single JSON object containing the results.

          chat_template_kwargs: Additional configuration to pass to model engine.

          context_length_exceeded_behavior: Defined the behavior of the API when max_tokens exceed the maximum context
              length of the model. When set to 'error', API will return 400 with appropriate
              error message. When set to 'truncate', override the max_tokens with maximum
              context length of the model.

          echo: If true, the response will contain the prompt. Can be used with `logprobs` to
              return prompt logprobs.

          frequency_penalty: A number between -2.0 and 2.0 where a positive value decreases the likelihood of
              repeating tokens that have already been mentioned.

          logit_bias: Adjusts the likelihood of specific tokens appearing in the generated output.

          logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 of the top k tokens to return log probabilities for
              at each generation step, instead of just the sampled token. Log probabilities
              help assess model confidence in token predictions.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate.

          min_p: A number between 0 and 1 that can be used as an alternative to top_p and top-k.

          n: The number of completions to generate for each prompt.

          presence_penalty: A number between -2.0 and 2.0 where a positive value increases the likelihood of
              a model talking about new topics.

          reasoning: For models that support toggling reasoning functionality, this object can be
              used to control that functionality.

          reasoning_effort: Controls the level of reasoning effort the model should apply when generating
              responses. Higher values may result in more thoughtful and detailed responses
              but may take longer to generate.

          repetition_penalty: A number that controls the diversity of generated text by reducing the
              likelihood of repeated sequences. Higher values decrease repetition.

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured
              Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more
              in the [Structured Outputs guide](https://docs.together.ai/docs/json-mode).

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which
              ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is
              preferred for models that support it.

          safety_model: The name of the moderation model used to validate tokens. Choose from the
              available moderation models found
              [here](https://docs.together.ai/docs/inference-models#moderation-models).

          seed: Seed value for reproducibility.

          stop: A list of string sequences that will truncate (stop) inference text output. For
              example, "</s>" will stop generation as soon as the model generates the given
              token.

          temperature: A decimal number from 0-1 that determines the degree of randomness in the
              response. A temperature less than 1 favors more correctness and is appropriate
              for question answering or summarization. A value closer to 1 introduces more
              randomness in the output.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. By default uses `auto`,
              which lets the model pick between generating a message or calling a function.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for.

          top_k: An integer that's used to limit the number of choices for the next predicted
              word or token. It specifies the maximum number of tokens to consider at each
              step, based on their probability of occurrence. This technique helps to speed up
              the generation process and can improve the quality of the generated text by
              focusing on the most likely options.

          top_p: A percentage (also called the nucleus parameter) that's used to dynamically
              adjust the number of choices for each predicted token based on the cumulative
              probabilities. It specifies a probability threshold below which all less likely
              tokens are filtered out. This technique helps maintain diversity and generate
              more fluent and natural-sounding text.

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request
